Iâ€™m a software engineer working mainly in the South West of England. With over 20 **different** years' of experience across the whole development lifecycle, I've worked on initial project scoping through to project delivery. With roles ranging between unit tester to architect.

As such, I consider myself as a [T-Shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) person with the most depth in .NET and agile methodologies.

Most of the older content on this site is from my days working as a Scrum Master. I'm keeping it around in the hope that it helps someone. The [Halloween Special Retrospective](/blog/retrospective-experience-halloween-special/) in particular gets a bit of traffic each year in October.
