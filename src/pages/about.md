Iâ€™m a software engineer working mainly in the South West of England. With over 15 **different** years' of experience across the whole development lifecycle, I've worked on initial project scoping through to project delivery. With roles ranging between unit tester to architect.

As such, I consider myself as a [T-Shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) person with the most depth in .NET and Agile methods.

## Current Focus

I'm _trying_ to stay up to date with all things .NET and Azure.

My current big push is to switch from a rabid _consumer_ to a prolific _producer_ of content.

I'm constantly striving to learn, so if you think I'm missing a trick, please get in touch at <https://twitter.com/mattdufeu>.
