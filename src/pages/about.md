Iâ€™m a contract C# Developer/Architect working in the South West of England.

I specialised in .NET in 2000, moving to front end technologies like ASP.NET MVC and JavaScript approximately 4 years ago. While _trying_ to stay up to date with all things .NET and Azure, I&#8217;m currently spending a lot of my time working with Angular.

Although I&#8217;m a fully qualified Scrum Master and this blog contains a lot of content that I hope fellow Scrum Masters find useful, I&#8217;ve decided I prefer keeping my hands &#8220;dirty&#8221;.

Most importantly, I&#8217;m constantly striving to learn. So if you think I&#8217;m missing a trick, please get in touch on [twitter][1] or leave a comment.
