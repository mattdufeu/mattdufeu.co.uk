Iâ€™m an independent .NET Developer working mainly in the South West of England. I've got 16 **different** years' of experience across the whole development lifecycle.

I've worked on initial project scoping through to project delivery and all tasks in between from unit tester to architect.

As such, I consider myself as a [T-Shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) person with the most depth in .NET and Agile methods.

## Not management?

In late 2016, I decided the managerial career route wasn't for me. The lack of hands on coding was too high a price to pay. So I decided to go out on my own and keep my hands "dirty".

A fair bit of the older content on this blog comes from the days I was a scrum master. I think it's still useful others in the same boat, but as you'll see, the newer content in more technical in nature.

## Current Focus

I'm _trying_ to stay up to date with all things .NET and Azure. But I also spend a lot of my time working with React and React Native.

My current big push is to switch from a rabid _consumer_ to a prolific _producer_ of content.

I'm striving to learn. So if you think I'm missing a trick, please get in touch at <https://twitter.com/mattdufeu>.

## Work With Me

I help companies deliver their ideas to their customers faster.

Whether you need help adopting agile practices, or you need an experienced head to bolster velocity by being hands on, I can help.

If you would like to work with me, or find out more about what I can do to help, drop me an email at [matt@mattdufeu.co.uk](mailto:matt@mattdufeu.co.uk).
