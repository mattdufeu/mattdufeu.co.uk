To make the team think a different way during the retrospective I decided to try [6 Thinking Hats][1]. We&#8217;re used to saying what went well and what didn&#8217;t, so I thought this would be a good way to get some different discussions going.

I was a little nervous beforehand as the description warns about something I&#8217;ve been struggling with in previous sprints, namely facilitating rather than controlling. So at least the technique forced me to deal with that head on!

> &#8220;Tip: The facilitator should try to stay out of the circle and try to avoid the participants talking directly to them&#8221;

I was also a little worried that I was flooding the team with lots of new techniques, so we used [ESVP][2] as a check-in exercise like we did [a few sprints ago][3]. This not only did the job of getting everyone off their feet, but we had a much better split of positive over negative categories this time, so it gave me a nice boost too.

### Gather Data, Generate Insights and Decided What To Do

Things started slowly as we didn&#8217;t really know what we were doing (see Personal Retrospective below) and we&#8217;re not used to Blue hat thinking, but once we got onto topics we felt comfortable with the meeting progressed well.

I found facilitation to be quite hard to begin with, as it seemed like the team were stopping to see what I wrote on the board, but again, that seemed to improve as time went on.

Finally, I won&#8217;t go into the actual details, but the meeting ended on a really positive note and there seemed to be a real air of optimism for the next sprint. It will be interesting to see if that&#8217;s something this technique brings, or we just had a good retrospective. It was certainly more noticeable than previous retrospectives, _but_ that could be coincidence.

### Summary

The exercise started slowly with the team talking directly to me, but as things progressed and we got onto topics we&#8217;re more comfortable with &#8211; what went well, what went badly &#8211; time started to fly.

I&#8217;m lucky as I have several strong characters who are more than willing to lead such a debate (which could be a bad thing if they dominate), but if I didn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m sure there are ways around that.

Overall, I think it&#8217;s a good exercise to conduct and one I&#8217;ll certainly use again.

### Personal Retrospective

#### What went well?

- The team produced some good insights, which is a good sign we can become more self-organising;

#### What could I have done better?

- A team member mentioned that the strictness of the hats meant he couldn&#8217;t/didn&#8217;t say something when he thought of it and then forgot. I could provide pen and paper or perhaps tell everyone that than anything could be mentioned and if it&#8217;s not allowed we&#8217;ll note it for later;
- I don&#8217;t think the time slots of 10 minutes needs to be a strict rule. Next time, we&#8217;ll treat it as a time-box, rather than &#8220;we must talk for 10 minutes&#8221;.

#### What should I not do again?

- I&#8217;m not convinced I explained the hats particularly well, so next time I&#8217;ll try to give examples of each before starting the exercise.
- Related to that, I didn&#8217;t use the results from the previous hats to guide the conversation for subsequent hats particularly well. During the write up I noticed a few facts we didn&#8217;t discuss.
