I&#8217;ve taken the advice of [Scott Hanselman][1] and [Rob Conery][2] in their [Get Involved!][3] Pluralsight course and have installed Markdown (or perhaps more accurately the [Markdown on Save Improved plugin][4]). I haven&#8217;t even begun to get to grips with the syntax, but I can certainly see how much easier it&#8217;s going to become to write posts.

Speaking of which, I&#8217;ve realized why I&#8217;m finding it harder and harder to write. (Excuse the over use of Markdown)

> &#8220;I&#8217;m basically doing very very little SharePoint at the moment!&#8221; 

In my 9-5 job (which is more like 8-5 + work from home) I&#8217;m acting as a Product Owner and in those rare moments where I do get some &#8220;me time&#8221; I&#8217;m revising for 70-486.

The Get Involved! course warns about using names that pigeon hole you into something, so I&#8217;ve dropped the SharePoint from the blog name.
