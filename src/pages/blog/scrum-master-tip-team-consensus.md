In [Scrum Master Tip &#8211; Many Voices][1] I listed a few things to try if your team meetings are dominated by one person and you want to hear from the others in the team.

On a similar note, I&#8217;ve found the following tips useful to Team consensus on decisions.

## Issue to Avoid

Failing to get buy-in from the _whole_ team on important decisions.

## Why is it a problem?

If someone doesn&#8217;t agree with a decision, they are unlikely to follow it. At worse, they will become unmotivated and disruptive and slowly drag the team around them down.

I try to save these alternative techniques for the important decisions and fall back on the simple consent check of &#8220;does everyone agree?&#8230;ok then, decision made&#8221; for day to day things.

## Potential Solutions

With all of these solutions, there&#8217;s a risk that the more timid members of your team are copying the dominant person, so keep an eye out and if need be, split the group up.

### Roman Voting

After 3, everyone gives a thumbs up or thumbs down. other.

### Vote with your feet

Imagine there is a line along one wall where one end is agree and the other is disagree and ask the team to stand along the wall depending how strongly .

#### Consensus Check

Use planning poker cards where a higher number is more agreement.
