Iâ€™m a software engineer working mainly in the South West of England. With over 17 **different** years' of experience across the whole development lifecycle, I've worked on initial project scoping through to project delivery. With roles ranging between unit tester to architect.

As such, I consider myself as a [T-Shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) person with the most depth in .NET, Agile methods and JavaScript.

Most of the older content on this site is from my days working as a Scrum Master. I'm keeping it around in the hope that it helps someone. The [Halloween Special Retrospective](/blog/retrospective-experience-halloween-special/) in particular gets a bit of traffic each year in October.

### Current Focus

I'm _trying_ to stay up to date with all things .NET and Azure. If that wasn't hard enough, it's becoming increasingly popular for a .NET backend to be sitting behind a front-end built using a JavaScript framework such as React, Vue or Angular. A decent chunk of my time is spent staying up to date with React and Vue.

My current aim is to switch from a rabid _consumer_ to a prolific _producer_. Using this site to share my knowledge, focussing on helping others C#/.NET developers feel comfortable working with JavaScript in the front end.

I'm constantly striving to learn, so if you think I'm missing a trick, please get in touch at <https://twitter.com/mattdufeu>.
