### Background

I&#8217;ve just started working on a brand new project as a Scrum Master for a team of 7. There&#8217;s quite a mixed bag of experience, ranging from other scrum masters to agile first timers.

For our first retrospective I wanted something simple to explain, but also simple to take part in. The [4Ls technique][1] leapt out at me.

### Variation

For me, &#8220;lacked&#8221; and &#8220;longed for&#8221; are too similar, so I always make a slight adjustment and use &#8220;Liked&#8221;, &#8220;Learned&#8221;, &#8220;Longed For&#8221; and &#8220;Loathed&#8221;. Loathed is a strong word, but I find it helps the team highlight things that _are_ slowing them down, whereas &#8220;lacked&#8221; is things that _might_ speed them up.

I also add a strict rule of &#8220;no more than 6 points each&#8221; and you &#8220;_must_ have one point in each column&#8221;. Why did I do this? Two reasons:

1. It focuses everyone to their most important points to prevent a flood
2. It forces everyone to think of positive things, &#8220;Liked&#8221; and &#8220;Learned&#8221;, that happened during the sprint. Which I find sometimes doesn&#8217;t happen.

I find these two rules help me facilitate the meeting as I can control the duration and topics discussed more easily and prevent the retrospective becoming a moaning session.

### Why you would use this technique

An awful lot of the internet nowadays seems to be _how_ to do something, but not the _why_. It&#8217;s become a bit of a pet peeve of mine, so I&#8217;m going to try and list a few of the reasons as to why you would use this technique:

1. You&#8217;re a new Scrum Master looking for an easy technique to follow that doesn&#8217;t _need_ a lot of input
2. You&#8217;re a Scrum Master looking for a technique that doesn&#8217;t take too long
3. You&#8217;re a Scrum Master working on a team that is quite negative and want to get some positive points
4. You&#8217;re the Scrum Master of an inexperienced team and you want to ease them into retrospectives
5. You&#8217;re a Scrum Master who wants to freshen up your retrospectives without pushing the boat too far.

### Results

I&#8217;m really pleased with the results of this technique.

We got plenty of points to talk about and I felt in control of the whole retrospective. All the team members contributed and we ended up with some useful ideas to try for the next sprint.

As always, I&#8217;d love to hear of anyone else who has been in a similar situation and used a different technique. Why?

Please leave a comment below or catch me on [twitter][2] if you have any questions.

### Personal Retrospective

For my own future reference, I like to analyse my own performance.

### What Worked Well

- Restricting the team to 6 points with at least 1 in each column

### What Went Ok

- Giving an example of what I would chose for each column.
- It was useful to explain the technique, but I&#8217;m slightly concerned it put words in peoples mouths. Perhaps next time use examples that are _not_ to do with the topic, for example my feelings on a TV show.

### Change Next Time

- State explicitly that you can&#8217;t have a point that straddles a line between two of the Ls
