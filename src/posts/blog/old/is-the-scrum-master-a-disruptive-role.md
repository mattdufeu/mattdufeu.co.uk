While talking to one of my team during our regular chats, the number of changes I&#8217;ve challenged the team with came up. I was glad when he said he could see the value in them, but was surprised when he said he initially saw them as a **disruption**.

The scrum master role is seen as someone &#8220;protecting the team&#8221;, i.e. prevent disruptive outside influences from causing internal disruption. So I was initially worried, as that&#8217;s the opposite of what I&#8217;m supposed to do!

Before I did anything, I was wise enough to check with the other members to get their take on it. My favourite answer was (emphasis mine):

> &#8220;your job is to **push** the team and **challenge** them to do better&#8221;

I can see that could be taken as disruptive, so I did some digging. I couldn&#8217;t see much reference to the Scrum Master being a disruption, until I came across this <http://www.scruminc.com/the-power-of-disruptive-leadership/>. It&#8217;s quite hard to get the meaning of the presentation from just the slides, but I&#8217;m taking comfort in the title.

## Personal Conclusion

After a fair bit of thinking, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that &#8220;disruption&#8221; is as another tool in my belt. As long as I limit it&#8217;s use to when I think the team are stagnating, treading water or could simply do something better, it could be a very useful way to ultimately increase velocity. Importantly, I think as long as I don&#8217;t expect all of my suggestions to be acted upon and I&#8217;m more than willing to be told I&#8217;m wrong, I see no problem with it.

That&#8217;s my conclusion, but I&#8217;d be really interested to hear other opinions in the comments below or catch me on [twitter][1] if you prefer.
