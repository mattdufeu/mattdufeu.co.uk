I&#8217;ve just renewed the hosting and domain for this place and in two years I&#8217;ve written 14 posts&#8230; including this one!

Clearly I&#8217;m not an active blogger, but during some reflection I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that I&#8217;ve been putting off a lot stuff. What&#8217;s worse, when I do sit down I seem to get very little done as I&#8217;m over-thinking.

#### Turning Point?

Like anything nowadays, I turned to my friend google (other search engines are available) and came across this post from Scott Hanselman <a title="Analysis Paralysis: Over-thinking and Knowing Too Much to Just CODE" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AnalysisParalysisOverthinkingAndKnowingTooMuchToJustCODE.aspx" target="_blank">Analysis Paralysis: Over-thinking and Knowing Too Much to Just CODE</a> which rung very true.

From the number of comments, I&#8217;m clearly not the only person and there seems to be various ways people (try to) overcome it. I particularly liked the Chistopher Svec&#8217;s comment of &#8220;I usually have these 2 xkcd comics close at hand to help remind me to Just Do It / YAGNI&#8221; referring to <a title="https://xkcd.com/974/" href="https://xkcd.com/974/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/974/</a> & <a title="http://xkcd.com/1205/" href="http://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">http://xkcd.com/1205/</a>.

And if by coincidence, <a title="Doing nothing is cheap. Failure is cheaper." href="http://www.saidsvec.com/2014/05/09/doing-nothing-is-cheap-failure-is-cheaper/" target="_blank">the first post on Christopher&#8217;s blog</a> (at the time of writing has a title of:

> &#8220;Doing nothing is cheap. Failure is cheaper.&#8221;

Sums it up nicely. Off to think about coding ðŸ™‚
