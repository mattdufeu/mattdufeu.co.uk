It&#8217;s been over 6 months since I started using different retrospective techniques with my current team and although we are a long way from repeating the same thing over and over, I was beginning to worry about stagnation. A great deal of the techniques I&#8217;ve been using have essentially been &#8220;what are we doing wrong?&#8221;. I wanted something that was &#8220;what are we doing right&#8221;.

A quick bit of googling lead me to a post titled [Appreciative Inquiry Retrospectives][1] by Doug Bradbury. The following quote really stood out:

> &#8220;Are you discouraged and pessimistic about all the problems that your team has?&#8221;

We had our fair share of problems in the lead up to Christmas and the more I read, the better it sounded. A bit more digging and one of the search results was from one of my favourite tools, Retr-O-Mat. Turns out [Remember the Future][2] is also appreciative inquiry so I followed the link to [Diana Larsen&#8217;s post][3] on how to use the technique, and the rest is history.

### Result

We tried something different and I&#8217;m very pleased with how this technique played out. Looking forward to look back seems strange, but it resulted in different topics to those we normally see. In particular, I don&#8217;t think the managers in the room would&#8217;ve ever predicted the top most voted for topic.

There also seemed to be a confidence boost among the team. I&#8217;m putting this done to the fact that none of us discarded any of the points raised with &#8220;we&#8217;d have never done that&#8221;.

### Summary

Appreciative Inquiry offers a change of pace from most of the other techniques out there. I would highly recommend it if you&#8217;re just about to start a new release or have been hit with a load of problems, as it&#8217;s a great way of finding out what the team think should happen soon. One of the team afterwards also said (which I think is fantastic):

> &#8220;[it was] a great technique to celebrate our qualities&#8221;

Thanks to [@dougbradbury][4] for his post which started my research, [@findingmarbles][5] for Retr-O-Mat and [@dianaofportland][6] for the details of how to perform the technique.

### Personal Retrospective

### What went well?

- Flipping the direction of the retrospective from backwards looking to forward looking was great;
- Discovering an unexpected desire from the team;
- We got the chance to highlight both our individual and team successes;
- The team confidence boost

### What could I have done better?

- I should&#8217;ve provided more examples of team and individual qualities as we didn&#8217;t get many of those.

### What should I not do again

- Forget over the Christmas holiday that the first Tuesday back is retrospective day ðŸ™‚
