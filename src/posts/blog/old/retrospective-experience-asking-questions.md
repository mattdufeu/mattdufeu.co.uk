We&#8217;re close to a big release and things have been going well &#8211; think 200%+ increase in velocity from when we started the release (and we were good already ) &#8211; but our last couple of retrospectives felt a little flat, possibly because the big wins have already been made. I wanted a technique to really get the team involved.

### Back to Basic

In my research, I went back to the old favourite [Getting Value out of Agile Retrospectives][1] written by [Luis Gonçalves][2] and [Ben Linders][3] .

&#8220;Asking Questions&#8221; is aimed at new scrum masters who have never facilitated a retrospective before, so I decided to tweak the format a little.

### Tweak 1

Rather than asking the question, I printed them out, cut them up and put them all in a pile in the middle of the table. Importantly, the questions are all folded up so you can&#8217;t tell what piece of paper held what question.

### Tweak 2

Rather than the Scrum Master asking the question, taking turns, I asked each team member to pick a question from the pile, read it out to the team and then give an answer. The rest of the team were then encouraged to discuss the response.

I&#8217;m pleased to say this lead to a lot more group involvement than the last couple of retrospectives and we managed to find a couple of tweaks as well as a bit of forward planning for the next release.

### Summary

The book says this is a great technique to use if you&#8217;ve never facilitated a retrospective before. The tweaks I made may or may not help this, but it certainly got the team involved and resulted in some great actions.

So another fantastic technique that I would recommend to a newbie or expert Scrum Master, especially if they want fantastic team engagement.

I&#8217;d be really interested to hear anyone trying this technique in the comments below or catch me on [twitter][4] if you prefer.

### Personal Retrospective

### What went well

- Adapting the &#8220;beginners&#8221; technique to increase team involvement
- Sitting with the team, rather than standing at the front or walking around the room seemed to increase team participation

### What could I have done better?

- Changed the wording of the questions from &#8220;what could _you_&#8221; to &#8220;what could _we_&#8220;

### What should I not do again?

- Not spell check the questions
