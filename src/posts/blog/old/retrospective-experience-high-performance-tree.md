For this retrospective, I was struggling to pick an appropriate technique. The team&#8217;s velocity has been creeping up and the actions from each retrospective were mostly minor tweaks. So I hit the books and saw this in the &#8220;When you would use this exercise&#8221; heading of Luis Gonçalves and Ben Linders [Getting Value out of Agile Retrospectives book][1] chapter on &#8220;High Performance Tree&#8221;:

> &#8220;A good team that is looking for the next step to become a high-performing team&#8221;

Clearly that sounded perfect, and after a little more digging I found a fantastic video by Lyssa Adkins called [The High Performance Tree][2] which demonstrates the technique perfectly.

## Gather Data, Generate Insights and Decide What To Do

I was a little nervous about using the metaphor as it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;ve done before and I&#8217;d read that the team can get a little uncomfortable. Thankfully that didn&#8217;t happen at all.

I won&#8217;t re-iterate the steps, or embarrass myself by including a photo of the &#8220;tree&#8221; I drew, but I will say that each root, leaf and fruit led to really interesting discussions. Having a visual representation of our target worked really well. It helped guide the conversation towards parts we are missing, but also towards part we are doing well.

## Summary

I can&#8217;t list all the outcomes, but I&#8217;m particular pleased we realised we don&#8217;t currently have a &#8220;can do anything&#8221; attitude but perhaps should. I&#8217;m really hoping we can turn that around in coming sprints.

Overall, this was a great technique and we had an excellent retrospective. If you&#8217;re a ScrumMaster of a mature team and are looking for inspiration to become high performing, I&#8217;d definitely recommend this technique.

## Personal Retrospective

## What went well?

- My drawing of the tree!
- The team responded well and it was good to go back to first principles

## What could I have done better?

- When writing up the meeting, I noticed a few points that we said we&#8217;d get back to, but didn&#8217;t. I need to come up with a better way of tracking these points.

## What should I not do again?

I don&#8217;t think anything went so badly that I can put in this category.
