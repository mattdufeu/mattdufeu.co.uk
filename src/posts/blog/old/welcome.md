Hi and welcome to my blog about all things SharePoint (hence the sp in the url).

I&#8217;m a software engineer working in the South West of  England and have recently discovered SharePoint. I&#8217;ve spent the previous 2-3 years as a Technical Analyst so I&#8217;m really enjoying getting back in touch with my inner code monkey. So far I&#8217;ve taken and passed <a title="Exam 70-573" href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?id=70-573" target="_blank">exam 70-573</a> so have a MCTS in SharePoint 2010, Application Development and hope to pass the MCPD exam soon.

Obviously the world isn&#8217;t short of blogs, or even blogs about SharePoint and I&#8217;m far from a SharePoint expert&#8230;yet, so I&#8217;m blogging to help keep a record of all the new stuff I&#8217;m learning on a daily (if not more frequently) basis. There&#8217;s obviously an ego to stroke but if something I babble about helps someone else &#8211; even if it&#8217;s me in the future &#8211; then I won&#8217;t have wasted the money on the domain and hosting. To start with, I imagine the posts will be extremely basic and not terribly well written, but with time I&#8217;m hoping both will improve.

Please feel free to leave comments and please get in touch if you see a mistake. If you prefer email, feel free to send me an email to Dufeu at spdufeu.co.uk. Alternatively, I&#8217;m also on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sharepointdufeu" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Twitter</a>.
