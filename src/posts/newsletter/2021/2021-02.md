**I'm going to keep posting my newsletter onto the site, but delayed by a month. The hope is you can see see what you'd be getting in your inbox without having to provide an email address, but I do still hope you'll subscribe. One day I might be able to provide more of an incentive than "you'll get it a month early".**

This month I've got a links to the comment system I've added to this site called Staticman, a guide to publishing preview NuGet packages in Azure Devops and Heroku.

As with all the links I put in my newsletter, I've found them useful that month, so hopefully you will too. As always, if you think something is wrong, please let me know.

## Adding comments to this site

This site used to run on WordPress, but I moved it to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Comments were the big feature I missed from WordPress, but it turns out you can get comments for static sites with a little work.

I settled on using [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) and am very happy with the result (although I'm yet to receive a real-world comment). Despite some teething troubles [I managed to add Staticman](/blog/adding-staticman-comments-to-a-gatsby-site/) with a little effort. So if you're looking to add comments to your static site, I can recommend it.

## Preview NuGet packages in Azure DevOps

I wanted to add preview NuGet packages to my Azure DevOps artifact feed and couldn't find a nice automated way of doing it.

I eventually found <https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/en-gb/technetuk/2019/06/18/perfecting-continuous-delivery-of-nuget-packages-for-azure-artifacts/> and it's got all the information I needed.

I learned about GitVersion and how that can tag builds if they are from certain branches. You can then carry this tag through the rest of the pipeline and include this tag in the NuGet package name. I had to refer to the [GitVersion configuration](https://gitversion.net/docs/reference/configuration) documentation to make it work as I think it's changed in the latest version, but I soon had "-alpha" NuGet packages that showed up in Visual Studio.

## Heroku

I'm using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for free to host my staticman instance. I doubt very much that I've scratched the surface of what Heroku offers, but I was very impressed with how slick it was. Did I mention it was free?
